   * Planning to move ray casting and crossings distances to global memory, currently occuping
     48Kb per thread, this is causing stack size issues
   * There are two copies of the ray casting distances for performance reasons, extra 16KB
   * Benchmark of nighlies before changes
      - Criticality Accident - 256x256 = GPU time = 10.9575 secs
      - PWR fuel assembly - 256x256  = GPU time = 6.71193 secs

   * Converted to use basic ray casting distances from global memory, extra copies may still exist,
     crossings distances not yet converted.
   * Nightlies
      - Criticality Accident - 390x256 = GPU time = 21.80 secs
      - PWR fuel assembly    - 390x256 = GPU time = 15.19 secs
